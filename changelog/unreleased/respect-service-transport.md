Enhancement: Respect service transport

The service registry now takes into account the service transport when creating grpc clients. This allows using `dns`, `unix` and `kubernetes` as the protocol in addition to `tcp`. `dns` will turn the gRPC client into a [Thick Client](https://grpc.io/blog/grpc-load-balancing/#thick-client) that can look up multiple endpoints via DNS. `kubernetes` will use [github.com/sercand/kuberesolver](https://github.com/sercand/kuberesolver) to connect to the kubernetes API and pick up service changes. Furthermore, we enabled round robin load balancing for the [default transparent retry configuration of gRPC](https://grpc.io/docs/guides/retry/#retry-configuration).
